# xibanalyzer

This is a metatool for examining XIB file structure and generating a set of files to parse the structure.
This is a deprecated metatool that was used to create files to help parse XIB files.  We now have a new
XIB parsing framework integrated into libs-gui.

This application is being left in for educational purposes only.
